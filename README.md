# Graph_representation

Graph reprsentation in python is very easy in comparision to C,CPP.
As we know there are several type of graph representation
Adjacency matrix, Adjacency list etc. In C,CPP for every reprsentation we
require diffrent type of structure but in Python we require only one 
structure .
